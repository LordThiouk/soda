# SODAV Monitor App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
New users who visit SODAV Monitor are greeted by a modern and inviting landing page that outlines the system’s core functionality. The landing page clearly directs users to sign in or sign up. When a brand-new user decides to create an account, they are presented with a clean sign-up form where personal details are requested. The system uses Supabase authentication which supports email-based registration, and although social login options are not the primary method, the basic structure can be extended to include them if necessary. Once the information is submitted, the account is registered and the user can log in. For those who already have an account, a login page is available where credentials are entered. If users run into forgotten passwords, a clear “Forgot Password” option is visible on the sign-in page. This option leads to a workflow where a recovery link or code is sent to the user’s email. Once the password is reset and updated, the user can return to logging in. Additionally, after successful sign in, users may choose to sign out safely via a designated logout button, ensuring that no unauthorized access occurs once their session is finished.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, users are directed to the main dashboard which acts as the central hub of SODAV Monitor. The dashboard presents an interactive view that displays real-time airplay statistics and dynamic charts. The interface provides a clear layout with headers at the top and a navigation sidebar along the left side. This sidebar includes quick access to key sections such as the main monitoring dashboard, detailed analytics pages, the reports section, and account settings. The central area shows real-time updates from radio broadcasts, including play counts, timestamps, and trend analysis. The use of interactive charts allows users to engage with the data immediately, and the design is responsive to offer a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices. Navigation between pages is intuitive; clicking on a station or a specific metric will smoothly transition the user to more detailed analytics or reporting views.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
Within the dashboard, the real-time monitoring view is where users observe live updates of tracked songs and airplay events. As songs are detected, the system uses a layered approach starting with local audio fingerprint matching, checking first with Acoustid, and lastly with Audd if needed. This detection process is visible in the dashboard, where each song’s playtime is logged with accurate timestamps. Users can click on any broadcast event, which opens a detailed view showing comprehensive track info such as title, artist, album, ISRC code, and the station on which the track was played. From the dashboard, there is a clear link to analytics pages dedicated to individual radio stations. Those analytics pages offer capabilities such as filtering data by time range, genre, or station, and users have the ability to drill down into the statistics for a precise understanding of airplay patterns. Additionally, the reports section provides a compilation of historical data including detailed reports on play counts, average duration, and comparison charts between stations. This section also features an option where users can manually adjust or verify the logged song information in cases of misidentification. The flow is built to make it simple for the user to navigate from real-time data to detailed historical trends, ensuring that every click leads to a logical continuation of information exploration.

## Settings and Account Management
Users can manage their accounts and update personal preferences through the settings page. This page can be accessed through the navigation sidebar or from an account icon typically located in the header. Within settings, users have the option to update personal information such as their name, email address, or password. Additionally, role-based controls are implemented so that only authorized copyright managers can access advanced settings and sensitive data controls. There is also a dedicated billing section, although the service remains free, which means that users might still view subscription status and account usage details. A clear and straightforward design allows users to modify notification settings, adjust data refresh intervals for the monitoring process, and choose how frequently they receive updated reports. Once settings are saved, users can return to the main dashboard with no interruption to the flow of data display or real-time statistics.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
When users enter invalid data or attempt actions that are not permitted, the system provides clear and concise error messages. If a user submits an incorrect email format during sign-up or login, a friendly error message is shown immediately explaining the issue and prompting a correction. In case of network problems or lost connectivity during real-time updates, a fallback page appears which notifies the user of connectivity issues while still allowing access to previously loaded data in a cached mode. For instance, if an attempted manual adjustment encounters an error such as unauthorized permission or a data conflict, the system displays a notification with guidance on how to resolve the issue. Each error state is designed in a way that users can easily navigate back to a working state, either by refreshing the page, reattempting login, or revisiting the settings to update information. This robust error handling process ensures that even if mistakes occur, users are promptly guided back to normal operation.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the very first visit to SODAV Monitor, users experience a clear and straightforward flow. They begin at a modern landing page that directs them through account creation and secure sign in. After authentication, users land on a dynamic dashboard where real-time monitoring of radio airplay is front and center. Every key aspect of the application, from detailed analytics with interactive drill-down options to comprehensive report generation, is seamlessly connected to allow copyright managers to monitor, analyze, and verify music play data. Account settings and error handling strategies ensure that even routine maintenance and unexpected problems are managed smoothly. This end-to-end journey – from initial sign-up, through daily monitoring and analysis, to concluding with manual data adjustments – reflects a carefully curated experience that emphasizes accuracy, transparency, and user empowerment at every step.
